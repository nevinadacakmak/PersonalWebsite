          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I am a 2nd year Computer Science student at the University of
            Toronto, in Information Systems stream which also imparts an
            appreciation of the CS's transformative impact on science and
            society. My passion lies in the intersection of technology and human
            learning, and I am committed to promoting gender equality in STEM
            fields. With over seven years of experience in FIRST robotics
            programs, I have served as a member, team lead, and mentor.
          </p>
          <p>
            My technical skills include proficiency in C, Python, Java, HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript. I am actively engaged in the tech community,
            holding leadership roles such as Vice President of Operations for
            the Data Science & Statistics Society (
            <a href="https://ds3utsc.com/">ds3utsc.com</a>) and Co-Founder &amp;
            Co-President of C.R.E.A.T.E. at UTSC.

            My love for drawing and creating art mirrors my interest in
            front-end development, where I enjoy crafting beautiful and
            functional websites. Altough I am not sure about which CS field I
            want to dive into, I am exploring my options as much as I can.
            Currently, I am learning about front-end & PM.
