          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>Merhaba! Hello!</p>
          <p>
            I’m Ada, a Freshman Computer Science student at the University of
            Toronto with a passion for all things tech. When I’m not diving into
            coding or exploring robotics and AI, you can find me spending time
            in my favorite hobbies like chess, drawing, and basketball, or
            simply spending time with my dog (Pako - photos in photos-content
            section).
          </p>
          <p>
            I also enjoy playing Minecraft, building epic worlds and getting on
            virtual adventures. In addition, I am an avid chess player with a
            rating of 2100+ on Lichess. I have about 25 days of gameplay,
            however it is not a dedicated time, just a hobby.
