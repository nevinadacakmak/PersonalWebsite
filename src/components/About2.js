          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>Merhaba! Hello!</p>
          <p>
            I’m a 2nd year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto
            with a passion for all things tech. When I’m not diving into coding
            or exploring robotics and AI, you can find me spending time in my
            favorite hobbies like chess, drawing, and basketball, or simply
            spending time with my dog (Pako - photos below).
          </p>
          <p>
            I also enjoy playing Minecraft, building epic worlds and getting on
            virtual adventures. In addition, I am an avid chess player with a
            rating of 2100+ on Lichess. I have about 25 days of gameplay,
            however it is not a dedicated time, just a hobby.
