          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>Merhaba! Hello!</p>
          <p>
            I’m Ada, a Freshman Computer Science student at the University of
            Toronto with a passion for all things tech. When I’m not diving into
            coding or exploring robotics and AI, you can find me indulging in my
            favorite hobbies like chess, drawing, and basketball, or simply
            spending time with my dog (Pako).
          </p>
          <p>
            My love for drawing and creating art mirrors my interest in
            front-end development, where I enjoy crafting beautiful and
            functional websites. I also enjoy playing Minecraft, building epic
            worlds and getting on virtual adventures.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, I am an avid chess player with a rating of 2100+ on
            Lichess. I have about 25 days of gameplay, however it is not a
            dedicated time, just a hobby. I also enjoy playing basketball and
            badminton.
