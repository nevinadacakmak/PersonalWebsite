      <h1>Hi there!</h1>
      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Merhaba! Hello!</p>
      <p>
        I’m Nevin Ada Çakmak, a Freshman Computer Science student at the
        University of Toronto with a passion for all things tech and a love for
        life’s quirky side. When I’m not diving into coding or exploring
        robotics and AI, you can find me indulging in my favorite hobbies like
        chess, Rubik's Cube solving, and basketball.
      </p>
      <p>
        My love for drawing and creating art mirrors my interest in front-end
        development, where I enjoy crafting beautiful and functional websites. I
        also enjoy spending time with my dog and playing Minecraft, building
        epic worlds and embarking on virtual adventures.
      </p>
    </div>
