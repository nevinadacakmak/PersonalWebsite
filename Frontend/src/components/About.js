      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I am Nevin Ada Ã‡akmak, a dedicated Computer Science student at the
        University of Toronto. My passion lies in the intersection of technology
        and psychology, and I am committed to promoting gender equality in STEM
        fields. With over seven years of experience in FIRST robotics programs,
        I have served as a member, team lead, and mentor.

        My technical skills include proficiency in C, Python, Java, HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript. I am actively engaged in the tech community, holding
        leadership roles such as Vice President of Operations for the Data
        Science & Statistics Society and Co-Founder and Co-President of
        C.R.E.A.T.E. I am currently working on building a personal portfolio
        website and a literature review on the impact of the pandemic on online
        education.

        In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I am an avid chess
        player with a rating of 2000+ on Lichess, a Rubik's Cube solver, and a
        basketball player. My diverse interests and commitment to excellence
        drive my continuous growth and contribution to the tech field.
