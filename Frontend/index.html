      <h1>Hi there!</h1>
      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I am Nevin Ada Çakmak, a dedicated freshman studying Computer Science at
        the University of Toronto. My passion lies in the intersection of
        technology and psychology, and I am committed to promoting gender
        equality in STEM fields. With over seven years of experience in FIRST
        robotics programs, I have served as a member, team lead, and mentor,
        currently holding the position of Alumni Mentor for the FIRST Robotics
        Competition Team 4th Dimension.
      </p>
      <p>
        My technical skills include proficiency in C, Python, Java, HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript. I am actively engaged in the tech community, holding
        leadership roles such as Vice President of Operations for the Data
        Science & Statistics Society and Co-Founder & Co-President of
        C.R.E.A.T.E. I am currently working on building a personal portfolio
        website and a literature review on the impact of the pandemic on online
        education, focusing on instructor perspectives, student performance, and
        participation at the university level.
      </p>
      <p>
        I aspire to become a software developer, with a focus on front-end
        development. My ongoing projects include AllergenAlert.co, a website
        built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to identify allergen trees based
        on user location, and my personal portfolio website, which showcases my
        skills and projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I am an avid chess
        player with a rating of 2000+ on Lichess, a Rubik's Cube solver, and a
        basketball player. My diverse interests and commitment to excellence
        drive my continuous growth and contribution to the tech field.

      <h1>Hi there!</h1>
      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Merhaba! Hello!</p>
      Hey there! I’m Nevin Ada Çakmak, a Freshman Computer Science student at
      the University of Toronto with a passion for all things tech and a love
      for life’s quirky side. When I’m not diving into coding or exploring the
      latest in robotics and AI, you can find me indulging in my favorite
      hobbies and interests. I’ve got a knack for problem-solving and
      creativity, which you might see reflected in my projects and pursuits.
      From strategizing in FIRST robotics competitions to solving Rubik’s Cubes
      and pushing my limits in classic chess (I’m rocking a 2000+ rating on
      Lichess!), I’m always up for a challenge. My love for basketball keeps me
      active, and drawing lets me unwind and express myself. <br /><br />
      I also enjoy the camaraderie of my dog and can’t get enough of
      Minecraft—building epic worlds and embarking on virtual adventures is my
      idea of a great time. If you’re curious about what else I’m up to, check
      out the “Cool Stuff You Can Hear Me Talking About” section!
